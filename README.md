🎮 PlayTopia – Console-Based OOP Game Suite (C++)
PlayTopia is a console-based game suite developed in C++ as a semester project for Object-Oriented Programming (OOP). The project demonstrates practical implementation of core OOP concepts such as inheritance, polymorphism, abstraction, and encapsulation through an interactive gaming system.
The application includes a menu-driven interface that allows users to select and play from two different games:
🕹️ Games Included
1. Coin Collector Mario
A grid-based adventure game where the player navigates a map to collect coins while avoiding obstacles.
Player movement using keyboard inputs (W/A/S/D)
Randomly generated coins and obstacles
Difficulty levels (Easy, Medium, Hard)
Score tracking and coin collection system
Player name input and dynamic gameplay
2. Highway Madness
A real-time arcade-style driving game where the player controls a car on a highway.
Real-time keyboard controls (A/D keys)
Randomly generated obstacles and coins
Collision detection system
Live score updates
Game-over handling and instructions menu
🧩 OOP Concepts Used
Inheritance: A base Game class with derived game classes (Mario, Highway)
Polymorphism: Virtual functions for play() and instructions()
Encapsulation: Game logic and data handled inside respective classes
Abstraction: Common game behavior defined through abstract base classes
🛠️ Technologies & Tools
Language: C++
Platform: Windows Console
Libraries: <windows.h>, <conio.h>, <thread>, <chrono>
📌 Key Features
Menu-driven multi-game system
Keyboard-based interaction
Dynamic scoring system
Console UI handling using cursor positioning
Randomized gameplay elements

This project was developed to strengthen understanding of object-oriented programming principles and real-time console application development in C++.
